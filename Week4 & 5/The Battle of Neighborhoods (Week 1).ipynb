    "In this project, I will discuss the similiarity of Toronto and New York city. I'm planning to analyze from serval sections. \n",
    "- First, we all know both Toronto and New York City are big cities. However, we may also wonder how big they are. So, I answer this question. \n",
    "- Secondly, one interesting point attracts me is that both cities have a lot of restaurants, but I want to know what kind of food people in the city have a preference for, such as Pizza vs burger, Italian food vs Japanese food, etc. \n",
    "- For the third question, I would like to discuss the public Utilities, I may answer some question like: Does New yorker have more public toilets? Or Does Toronto have more parks? \n",
    "- For the last question, I may spend some time to talk about something about the stucture of two cities. The question would be: Is the city's commercial buildings more concentrated or decentralized? But that would be an option."
