    "For many tourists, traveling is a good way to relax. They can go shopping in local malls, admire cultural relics in museums, and enjoy local cuisine. The real estate industry also uses this trend to build more hotels in the city to cater to the needs of travelers. As a result, a large number of hotels were built in Manhattan. Of course, there are many commercial factors to consider when building a hotel. One of the most important factors is geographic location."

The project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: In New York City if a property developer wants to open a new hotel which mainly provides services to travelers, where would you recommend that they open it?\n",

    "- List of Boroughs and neighborhoods of Manhattan with their geodata (latitude and longitude)\n",
    "- List of Subway metro stations in Manhattan with their address location \n",
    "- Venues data, particularly data related to travelers, for each Manhattan neighborhood (that can be clustered)\n",

    "- https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n",
    "- Foursquare API\n",

    "### How data will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "1. The link above contains a list of neighborhoods in Manhattan, with a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. We will download it from that link. \n",
    "2. After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those boroughs and neighborhoods.\n",
    "3. We need to select our interested information from those data, because the API will provide a lot of categories of data. \n",
    "4. Then, data cleaning, data wrangling will be done by using multiple machine learning skills in this process.\n",
    "5. Lastly, we will use K-means clustering and data visualization skills to show the result. "
