        "For many tourists, traveling is a good way to relax. They can go shopping in local malls, admire cultural relics in museums, and enjoy the local cuisine. The real estate industry also uses this trend to build more hotels in the city to cater to the needs of travelers. As a result, a large number of hotels were built in Manhattan. Of course, there are many commercial factors to consider when building a hotel. One of the most important factors is the geographic location."

        "Firstly, we need to get the list of neighborhoods in Manhattan. In this project, we use the data from this link (https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572). After gathering the data, we will populate the data into a pandas data frame and then visualize the neighborhoods in a map by using the Folium package. This allows us to perform a sanity check to make sure that the geographical coordinates data are correctly plotted in the manhattan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we will use the Foursquare API to get the top 200 venues that are within a radius of 1000 meters. We use the Foursquare Developer Account, which registered in the previous section, to obtain the Foursquare ID and secret key. We then make API calls to Foursquare passing the geographical coordinates of our Manhatten neighborhoods. Foursquare will return the venue data in JSON format and we will extract the venue name, venue category, venue latitude, and longitude. With the data, we can check how many venues were returned for each neighborhood and examine how many unique categories are needed. And we found that there are about 300 unique categories in those venue data. However, some of them are very similar, for example, \"Chinese Restuarant and India Restaurant\". So I combine those kinds of categories into one, like \"Restaurant\". Also, tourists may go to a lot of attractions, but these types are very scattered, I also put these into one category. Categories like \"Art Gallery\",\"Theater\",\"Museum\",\"Park\",\"Historical Site\",\"Bar\",\"Stadium\" are combined into one category names \"Sites\". Then, we will analyze each neighborhood by grouping the rows by neighborhood and taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. Since we are analyzing the \"Hotel\" for visitors, we will filter the \"Restaurant\", \"Hotel\", \"Sites\" as the venue category for the neighborhoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, we will perform a cluster on the data by using k-means clustering. We firstly for loop from 0 to 10 to find the proper number of clusters. And base the elbow point we found, we set the three to the cluster number. The results will allow us to identify which cluster has a high concentration of hotels while which neighborhoods have a fewer number of hotels with plenty of \"sites\". Based on the occurrence of hotels, restaurants, and sites, it will help us to answer the question as to which neighborhoods are most suitable to open new hotels."

        "Next, let's look at the first and second categories. In the first category, we find that restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions are relatively evenly distributed, but this shows that this area has undergone some development, and competition may be fierce. The second type of area also has many equity and tourist attractions, but the number of hotels is relatively small. I think it is a good location to open a new hotel."
